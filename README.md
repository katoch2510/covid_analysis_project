# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project focusing on Covid-19 data. The project reads and analyzes real-world Covid-19 datasets to extract meaningful insights through data visualization and statistical summaries.

## Features

- Loads Covid-19 dataset directly from an online source (CSV file).
- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Provides descriptive statistics of key attributes.
- Visualizes trends and relationships using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Generates clear, interpretable charts to understand Covid-19 spread patterns.
- Helps users explore Covid-19 data interactively and gain insights quickly.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The project uses the publicly available Covid-19 dataset from:  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SR1608/Datasets/main/covid-data.csv`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   
## Install required dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Run the analysis script:
python covid_analysis.py


## Purpose
This project aims to provide an easy-to-understand example of how to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data using Python, which can be extended or adapted for more advanced data science and public health research.

Feel free to customize or expand the project as per your requirements!

You just need to replace `<repository-url>` with your actual GitHub repo link after creating it.

If you want, I can also help you with instructions on how to create the GitHub repo and upload this README and your code. Just let me know!
